TODO:
-----

->Add an interrupt so that we update the lcd screen every 40ms so that we get 25fps
->Make the UART stdio work...
->Change project from C to C++
->Read "Stellaris Graphics Library Display Drivers" and read "Stellaris LaunchPad Workbook" (starting at lab 10 page 187), to 
	learn how to use the Graphics Library provided by TI so that i can use it to build the GUI more easily.
	Note: the display driver is just a module/class that exposes a predefined set of functions (specified by
		the grlib) that allows the grlib to interface with the lcd. Basically it is a bridge between the grlib
		and the LCD display. It is the driver that knows how to comunicate with the LCD.
