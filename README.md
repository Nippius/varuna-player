=============

An MP3 Player based on the ARM Cortex-M4.

The objective of this project is to create an MP3 Player using the Stellaris Launchpad LM4F120H5QR (now TM4C1233H6PM) dev board
for the base system, and a VSLI VS1053 chip as the mp3 decoder. Also there will be a TFT LCD Touch Screen as input and an SD-Card
reader as storage.

This project also uses the new TivaWare lib.
